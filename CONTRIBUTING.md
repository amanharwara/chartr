## Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please [do a search](https://github.com/amanharwara/chartr/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to make sure that the problem hasn't been reported already. When you are creating a bug report, please include as [many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out the [required template](https://github.com/amanharwara/chartr/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note**: If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc). Create an issue in this repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and/or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
